            <br/>
            <p>The Saco River Motor Lodge is nestled in the beautiful woods on the peaceful Saco River. As a young
              family, we wanted to create and design our grounds with families in mind. Our grounds has a large pool,
              playground for kids, firepits for roasting marshmellows, grills for barbeques and picnic table for added
              comfort. There is a little soccor field behind the building for kids to play on. Sit and relax by our
              large pool or swim, canoe, kayak and tube down the beautiful Saco River located right next to us. In the
              winter we have ski packages with many major ski mountains; Attitash, Wildcat, Cranmore and Shawnee Peak.
              All kinds of activities going on in and around the valley. Check out the links below to see some of what
              the Mount Washington Valley has to offer.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Located near North Conway, the lodge sits only minutes away from all the fun and adventures activities
              the area has to offer. A partial list of what is nearby includes 5 Major ski resorts, over 100 shopping
              outlets, hundreds of miles of hiking and cross country skiing trails, snowmobiling, summertime river
              canoeing and kayaking, legendary nightspots and over 60 restaurants to choose from. You name it and you
